# Social Media API

This is a social media REST API i built using Fast API. I have been comparing different ways to create APIs, from C#, Node.js, and now Python. I really enjoyed working with FastAPI, and found the name of the framework to be quite apt. It is extremely easy to get a fully fledged CRUD API up and running pretty quickly.

It's also very powerful, and the integration with SQLAlchemy, and the ease of authentication via JWT tokens are very nice.

I also was able to play around with Docker and Alembic, and setting that up for this project was pretty simple. Honestly the hardest part was creating a Docker test database to work with. If anyone has any good resources on how I can do that I'd love to hear from you!

This was a fun project to work on, I'd like to do another sometime.
